Black Fitch
===========

Integration tests for fitchfork assignments

## Usage
1. Clone black-fitch
2. main.cpp: `#include "black-fitch/prac3Tests.h"`
3. main(): `runTests()`
4. `g++ main.cpp prac3Tests.cpp <other_libraries> -o main_test.out`

## Notes
- It is your responsibility to edit your main.cpp and makefile (to remove black-fitch references) before uploading to fitchfork
- If a test case was not covered here, please open an issue and let us know
